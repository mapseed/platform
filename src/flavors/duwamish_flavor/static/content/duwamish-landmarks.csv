<p>The South Park Water Quality Facility would help to protect the Duwamish River from polluted stormwater runoff.</p>
</div>
<p>The Integrated Plan includes a project to protect the Duwamish River from polluted runoff by building a stormwater treatment facility in South Park, where 7th Avenue South meets the river.</p>
<p>The project will have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Underground equipment</li>
    <li>Above-ground structures including a small electrical controls building and a concrete structure, about 12 feet tall, 50 feet wide and 110 feet long</li>
    <li>Security fencing and lighting</li>
    <li>Controls that allow staff to operate the facility remotely, reducing how often staff would need to visit it for maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>SPU is in the process of evaluating stormwater treatment technologies for the facility. The analysis is expected to be complete in 2014. The expected project schedule would include:</p>

Celebration  to help restore this important waterway in the Tukwila/South Seattle  community.&nbsp; At this location, we'll focus on removing invasive weeds,  mulching and planting native plants. <br /><br /><span></span>Inspired by the efforts of the BECU employees who independently began  restoration work on over 10,000 square feet of shoreline along the  Duwamish River, and through a partnership with Forterra and the City of  Tukwila, BECU is issuing a friendly challenge to other businesses along  the river to join in restoring the shoreline habitat. Local businesses  can participate by donating money, volunteer labor, or both.<br /><span style=""""></span><br /><span style=""""></span>  	Much of the banks of the Duwamish River are overgrown with invasive  plants such as Himalayan blackberry that have choked out native  vegetation. These invasive species are destroying vital habitat for  salmon and other native wildlife, and make it more difficult for  Tukwila&rsquo;s workers and residents to enjoy the river.<br /><span style=""""></span><br /><span style=""""></span>  	Through the Restore the Duwamish Shoreline Challenge, we aim to unite  Tukwila&rsquo;s business community for this local environmental cause. There will be regularly scheduled events that will ultimately restore 150,000 square feet of riverbank along almost 1.5 miles of the Duwamish River.<br /><span style=""""></span><br />How You Can Get Involved: </font><ul style=""""><li style=""""><font size=""3""> 		Sponsor a section of the river.&nbsp; Funding is needed to purchase  restoration materials, recruit and support volunteers, and maintain  newly planted shoreline areas. Challenge sponsors will also receive  recognition at our launch event and will be featured in publicity  materials.</font></li><li style=""""><font size=""3""> 		Organize a team of volunteers to help with restoration projects.  Volunteer leaders can receive special training and help their workplace  get involved.</font></li><li style=""""><font size=""3""> 		Grant access. Much of the shoreline we hope to restore is on private  property. Granting permission for Challenge participants to work on your  property is a simple, but crucial step for our success.</font></li><li style=""""><font size=""3""> 		Help get the word out.&nbsp; Help others learn about the Challenge by  putting up fliers, and by informing clients, customers, and colleagues.</font></li><li style=""""><font size=""3""> 		Join a volunteer event. <u style=""""><strong style=""""><a title="""" style="""" href=""http://www.forterra.org/events/category/42"">check our Events Calendar</a></strong></u> to find the next volunteer&nbsp;restoration&nbsp;event at the Duwamish.</font></li></ul>  	<br /><span></span><font size=""4"">To volunteer or join the challenge, please contact:</font><br /><font size=""4""><span style=""line-height: 27px;""><br /></span></font><strong><font size=""4"">Hayes Swinney, Forterra &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></strong><br /><strong style=""font-size: medium;"">Email:</strong><font size=""3""> hswinney@forterra.org</font><br /><font size=""4""><strong>Phone: </strong>206-905-6909</font><br /><br /></div>

marker-iavkw6jk0,Groundwater contamination - Philip Services Corporation,"Groundwater contamination originating from the property owned by 
Philip Services Corporation (“PSC”) on Lucile Street near Airport Way 
has been a persistent issue in Georgetown.  Over the years since the 
1940’s, underground storage tanks at the property corroded and al-
lowed chemicals to leak into the soil and groundwater.  Eventually the 
tanks were removed an underground barrier, or “slurry wall,” was 
constructed around most of PSC’s property in order to prevent further 
migration of the contaminants. In 2010, a Cleanup Action Plan (CAP) 
was finalized with public comment and input on behalf of the 
Georgetown Community Council provided by Environment Interna-
tional, a consulting firm experienced in contaminated site cleanups. 
The Department of Ecology is close to releasing two milestone docu-
ments that are key to the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwa-
ter at the PSC site.  One is a review of the overall progress in the five 
years since the CAP was finalized, and the other is more specific, relat-
ed to the particular technology selected to remove a certain hard-
to
-
treat contaminant (1,4-dioxane) from the areas where it is found at con-
centrations of concern. 
The progress report is called a Periodic Review, and examines how 
well the cleanup action has performed so far, makes sure that human 
health and the environment are being adequately protected given the 
current progress, and identifies a few actions for improvement.  A Peri-
odic Review will happen every five years until the site has reached its 
cleanup goals. 
In the Periodic Review, Ecology reports that the cleanup is proceeding 
as expected.  However, new information is available about some of the 
chemicals being addressed in the cleanup, and Ecology is asking PSC 
to re-calculate potential soil and groundwater cleanup levels based on 
the new information, to compare them with the cleanup levels from the 
2010 CAP. 
The primary chemical that the cleanup has not yet effectively ad-
dressed is 1,4-dioxane in groundwater.  The CAP originally specified 
that the affected groundwater should be pumped out from a single 
location, treated with an “oxidant” (a chemical that breaks down the 
1,4-dioxane), and discharged to the sewer.  Today, it appears that 
there are multiple hot spots of contamination, and Ecology believes 
that a more effective method would be to inject the oxidant directly 
into the ground in several locations.  A study is also underway to find 
out whether there are bacteria that can help break down even more of 
the contamination.  Because this plan is different than the plan in the 
2010 CAP, the CAP needs an amendment. 
Public comment periods will be held for 30 days for each of these doc-
uments, once they are released.
Local residents will be notified by a 
mailer. You can learn more about the history of the site and status of 
the cleanup on these web pages:

    Goal
  </h2>
  <p>
    Increase Marra farms Local and community involvement. Create a safer and cleaner enviroment for youth. Marra farm has rich history of the of the community aroud it. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Challenges
  </h3>
  <p>
    Marra Farm has had a history of drug use and homelessness. As well as the most recent issue of cost and liability of community input wanting to change terrain.
  </p> 
  <h3>
    Status
  </h3>
  <p>
  As of most recent Marra farm has come under discussion of what to build and a higher community input and involvement. Right now being used by Concord Elementary School  and local gardeners. While the enevitable spring arrives the replanting of the food will increase community involvement.
  </p> 
  <h3>
    Progress Detail
  </h3>
  <p>
  Community involvement fluxiates less crime usually increases community involved in the marra Farm
  </p>
  <h3>
  Challenges and Bariers
  </h3>
  <p>
  Solutions on how to restore the Marra Farm will be plentyful, so choosing multiple or even a few would be difficult. Not to mention satisfying everyone would be very difficult 
  </p>
  <h3>Next step</h3>
  <p>
  Figure out the next step to restoring the marra farm. I will survey local homeowners near Marra Farm. If possible take input from Mr.Marra. Come up with a solution and testing out said solution for Marra Farm.

    Remake the playgorund area so kids can be more excited on going to the park and having fun. Also, add football marks to the field so it can be a football field for the South Park Soldiers. remove the Sand-Pit becacause it hasn't been used correctly. Like people pee and poop in it, no one really plays in it, and too many bugs in it. One other thing is to add huge lights facing the field so it can be more visible when the sun sets (safety).
