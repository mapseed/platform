polluted stormwater runoff.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Integrated Plan includes a project to protect the Duwamish River from polluted runoff by building a stormwater treatment facility in South Park, where 7th Avenue South meets the river.</p>\n<p>The project will have:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Underground equipment</li>\n    <li>Above-ground structures including a small electrical controls building and a concrete structure, about 12 feet tall, 50 feet wide and 110 feet long</li>\n    <li>Security fencing and lighting</li>\n    <li>Controls that allow staff to operate the facility remotely, reducing how often staff would need to visit it for maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>SPU is in the process of evaluating stormwater treatment technologies for the facility. The analysis is expected to be complete in 2014.

size=\"4\">12770 Gateway Dr.</font><br /><font size=\"4\">Tukwilla, WA 98168</font><br /><span></span><br /><br /><font size=\"3\">Join volunteers all along the  Duwamish River today as part of the larger Duwamish Alive! Celebration  to help restore this important waterway in the Tukwila/South Seattle  community.&nbsp; At this location, we'll focus on removing invasive weeds,  mulching and planting native plants. <br /><br /><span></span>Inspired by the efforts of the BECU employees who independently began  restoration work on over 10,000 square feet of shoreline along the  Duwamish River, and through a partnership with Forterra and the City of  Tukwila, BECU is issuing a friendly challenge to other businesses along  the river to join in restoring the shoreline habitat. Local businesses  can participate by donating money, volunteer labor, or both.<br /><span style=\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"></span>  \tMuch of the banks of the Duwamish River are overgrown with invasive  plants such as Himalayan blackberry that have choked out native  vegetation. These invasive species are destroying vital habitat for  salmon and other native wildlife, and make it more difficult for  Tukwila&rsquo;s workers and residents to enjoy the river.<br /><span style=\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"></span>  \tThrough the Restore the Duwamish Shoreline Challenge, we aim to unite  Tukwila&rsquo;s business community for this local environmental cause. There will be regularly scheduled events that will ultimately restore 150,000 square feet of riverbank along almost 1.5 miles of the Duwamish River.<br /><span style=\"\"></span><br />How You Can Get Involved: </font><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tSponsor a section of the river.&nbsp; Funding is needed to purchase  restoration materials, recruit and support volunteers, and maintain  newly planted shoreline areas. Challenge sponsors will also receive  recognition at our launch event and will be featured in publicity  materials.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tOrganize a team of volunteers to help with restoration projects.  Volunteer leaders can receive special training and help their workplace  get involved.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tGrant access. Much of the shoreline we hope to restore is on private  property. Granting permission for Challenge participants to work on your  property is a simple, but crucial step for our success.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tHelp get the word out.&nbsp; Help others learn about the Challenge by  putting up fliers, and by informing clients, customers, and colleagues.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tJoin a volunteer event. <u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><a title=\"\" style=\"\" href=\"http://www.forterra.org/events/category/42\">check our Events Calendar</a></strong></u> to find the next volunteer&nbsp;restoration&nbsp;event at the Duwamish.</font></li></ul>  \t<br /><span></span><font size=\"4\">To volunteer or join the challenge, please contact:</font><br /><font size=\"4\"><span style=\"line-height: 27px;\"><br /></span></font><strong><font size=\"4\">Hayes Swinney, Forterra &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></strong><br /><strong style=\"font-size: medium;\">Email:</strong><font size=\"3\"> hswinney@forterra.org</font><br /><font size=\"4\"><strong>Phone: </strong>206-905-6909</font><br /><br /></div>\n<hr style=\"clear:both;visibility:hidden;width:100%;\"></hr>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left;\">Sponsors<br /></h2>\n\n<div><div class=\"wsite-multicol\"><div class='wsite-multicol-table-wrap' style='margin:0 -15px'>\n<table class='wsite-multicol-table'>\n<tbody class='wsite-multicol-tbody'>\n<tr class='wsite-multicol-tr'>\n<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:33.333333333333%;padding:0 15px'>\n\n\n\n</td>\n<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:33.333333333333%;padding:0 15px'>\n\n\n\n</td>\n<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:33.333333333333%;padding:0 15px'></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div></div></div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>","title":"shoreline challenge","marker-color":"","marker-size":"","marker-symbol":"park2","id":"ci2qyz5f50ieba6s4frvf8643"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-122.271651,47.489834,0],"type":"Point"},"id":"ci9by7shp2sfcjbm469gib4xh"},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"Herring's House","styleUrl":"#icon-145","styleHash":"4d09cf07","description":"<h2 style=\"text-align:left;\">Herring's House<br /></h2>\n<span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:0px'></span><span style='position:relative;float:left;z-index:10;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px'><a><img class=\"wsite-image galleryImageBorder\" src=\"/uploads/3/3/0/4/3304643/7867091.png\" style=\"margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px;\" alt=\"Picture\" /></a><div style=\"display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;\"></div></span>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;display:block;\"><font size=\"4\">Herring&rsquo;s House is a 15.5 acre location was built in 1999 primarily as  habitat for juvenile Chinook salmon.&nbsp; The site is built around a  constructed intertidal estuary connected to the Duwamish River.

Over the years since the \n1940’s, underground storage tanks at the property corroded and al-\nlowed chemicals to leak into the soil and groundwater.  Eventually the \ntanks were removed an underground barrier, or “slurry wall,” was \nconstructed around most of PSC’s property in order to prevent further \nmigration of the contaminants. In 2010, a Cleanup Action Plan (CAP) \nwas finalized with public comment and input on behalf of the \nGeorgetown Community Council provided by Environment Interna-\ntional, a consulting firm experienced in contaminated site cleanups. \nThe Department of Ecology is close to releasing two milestone docu-\nments that are key to the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwa-\nter at the PSC site.  One is a review of the overall progress in the five \nyears since the CAP was finalized, and the other is more specific, relat-\ned to the particular technology selected to remove a certain hard-\nto\n-\ntreat contaminant (1,4-dioxane) from the areas where it is found at con-\ncentrations of concern. \nThe progress report is called a Periodic Review, and examines how \nwell the cleanup action has performed so far, makes sure that human \nhealth and the environment are being adequately protected given the \ncurrent progress, and identifies a few actions for improvement.  A Peri-\nodic Review will happen every five years until the site has reached its \ncleanup goals. \nIn the Periodic Review, Ecology reports that the cleanup is proceeding \nas expected.  However, new information is available about some of the \nchemicals being addressed in the cleanup, and Ecology is asking PSC \nto re-calculate potential soil and groundwater cleanup levels based on \nthe new information, to compare them with the cleanup levels from the \n2010 CAP. \nThe primary chemical that the cleanup has not yet effectively ad-\ndressed is 1,4-dioxane in groundwater.  The CAP originally specified \nthat the affected groundwater should be pumped out from a single \nlocation, treated with an “oxidant” (a chemical that breaks down the \n1,4-dioxane), and discharged to the sewer.  Today, it appears that \nthere are multiple hot spots of contamination, and Ecology believes \nthat a more effective method would be to inject the oxidant directly \ninto the ground in several locations.  A study is also underway to find \nout whether there are bacteria that can help break down even more of \nthe contamination.  Because this plan is different than the plan in the \n2010 CAP, the CAP needs an amendment. \nPublic comment periods will be held for 30 days for each of these doc-\numents, once they are released.\nLocal residents will be notified by a \nmailer.
