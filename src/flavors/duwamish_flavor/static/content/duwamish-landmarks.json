In 2010, the potentially liable parties prepared a draft Remedial Investigatin report that summarizes past investigations, identifies contaminants of concern, areas of concern and data gaps. In 2011, a draft data gaps work plan was prepared and likely will be implemented in summer/fall 2011.\n<br><br>For more information, please check out <a href=\"https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/gsp/Sitepage.aspx?csid=5056\">Department of Ecology webpage</a>.\n\n</small>\n",

The analysis is expected to be complete in 2014.

The reason I used this picture is because I think it is one of the best pictures that was taken of our team, and I just really enjoy the sunset.\n  </p>  \n  <img src=\"http://duwamishrowingclub.org/wp/wp-content/gallery-bank/gallery-uploads/o_1ahrj3ghh1uhagr1k87knm7bom.jpg\">\n  <p>  My name is James Suggs, I started rowing in 2010. I got into rowing by my mother, she introduced me to Michael Merta who then invited my sisters and I to start rowing. We were the first rowers on the team. Every year I got better and better at rowing, and I became more competitive. Over time our crew started growing and more people started joining. We started to go to rowing regattas, and by 2016 we had a pretty much had a full team.\n</p>\n</body>",

Celebration  to help restore this important waterway in the Tukwila/South Seattle  community.&nbsp; At this location, we'll focus on removing invasive weeds,  mulching and planting native plants. <br /><br /><span></span>Inspired by the efforts of the BECU employees who independently began  restoration work on over 10,000 square feet of shoreline along the  Duwamish River, and through a partnership with Forterra and the City of  Tukwila, BECU is issuing a friendly challenge to other businesses along  the river to join in restoring the shoreline habitat. Local businesses  can participate by donating money, volunteer labor, or both.<br /><span style=\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"></span>  \tMuch of the banks of the Duwamish River are overgrown with invasive  plants such as Himalayan blackberry that have choked out native  vegetation. These invasive species are destroying vital habitat for  salmon and other native wildlife, and make it more difficult for  Tukwila&rsquo;s workers and residents to enjoy the river.<br /><span style=\"\"></span><br /><span style=\"\"></span>  \tThrough the Restore the Duwamish Shoreline Challenge, we aim to unite  Tukwila&rsquo;s business community for this local environmental cause. There will be regularly scheduled events that will ultimately restore 150,000 square feet of riverbank along almost 1.5 miles of the Duwamish River.<br /><span style=\"\"></span><br />How You Can Get Involved: </font><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tSponsor a section of the river.&nbsp; Funding is needed to purchase  restoration materials, recruit and support volunteers, and maintain  newly planted shoreline areas. Challenge sponsors will also receive  recognition at our launch event and will be featured in publicity  materials.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tOrganize a team of volunteers to help with restoration projects.  Volunteer leaders can receive special training and help their workplace  get involved.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tGrant access. Much of the shoreline we hope to restore is on private  property. Granting permission for Challenge participants to work on your  property is a simple, but crucial step for our success.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tHelp get the word out.&nbsp; Help others learn about the Challenge by  putting up fliers, and by informing clients, customers, and colleagues.</font></li><li style=\"\"><font size=\"3\"> \t\tJoin a volunteer event. <u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><a title=\"\" style=\"\" href=\"http://www.forterra.org/events/category/42\">check our Events Calendar</a></strong></u> to find the next volunteer&nbsp;restoration&nbsp;event at the Duwamish.</font></li></ul>  \t<br /><span></span><font size=\"4\">To volunteer or join the challenge, please contact:</font><br /><font size=\"4\"><span style=\"line-height: 27px;\"><br /></span></font><strong><font size=\"4\">Hayes Swinney, Forterra &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></strong><br /><strong style=\"font-size: medium;\">Email:</strong><font size=\"3\"> hswinney@forterra.org</font><br /><font size=\"4\"><strong>Phone: </strong>206-905-6909</font><br /><br /></div>\n<hr style=\"clear:both;visibility:hidden;width:100%;\"></hr>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left;\">Sponsors<br /></h2>\n\n<div><div class=\"wsite-multicol\"><div class='wsite-multicol-table-wrap' style='margin:0 -15px'>\n<table class='wsite-multicol-table'>\n<tbody class='wsite-multicol-tbody'>\n<tr class='wsite-multicol-tr'>\n<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:33.333333333333%;padding:0 15px'>\n\n\n\n</td>\n<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:33.333333333333%;padding:0 15px'>\n\n\n\n</td>\n<td class='wsite-multicol-col' style='width:33.333333333333%;padding:0 15px'></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div></div></div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>",

Also known as Terminal  107, this portion of the riverbank was originally the construction site  for a marine terminal. In 1977, artifacts were found during the development process, which  halted all construction. The tribe and the community fought to preserve  the area, and today it now stands as a wildlife habitat and a lovely public access site that  overlooks the only original bends in the river. T-107 is an important  habitat node, or oasis, where returning salmon and other wildlife can  rest, feed and escape from predators… we want to keep it this way, and  make it even better by joining a volunteer habitat restoration party!",

        "description": "Groundwater contamination originating from the property owned by \nPhilip Services Corporation (“PSC”) on Lucile Street near Airport Way \nhas been a persistent issue in Georgetown.  Over the years since the \n1940’s, underground storage tanks at the property corroded and al-\nlowed chemicals to leak into the soil and groundwater.  Eventually the \ntanks were removed an underground barrier, or “slurry wall,” was \nconstructed around most of PSC’s property in order to prevent further \nmigration of the contaminants. In 2010, a Cleanup Action Plan (CAP) \nwas finalized with public comment and input on behalf of the \nGeorgetown Community Council provided by Environment Interna-\ntional, a consulting firm experienced in contaminated site cleanups. \nThe Department of Ecology is close to releasing two milestone docu-\nments that are key to the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwa-\nter at the PSC site.  One is a review of the overall progress in the five \nyears since the CAP was finalized, and the other is more specific, relat-\ned to the particular technology selected to remove a certain hard-\nto\n-\ntreat contaminant (1,4-dioxane) from the areas where it is found at con-\ncentrations of concern. \nThe progress report is called a Periodic Review, and examines how \nwell the cleanup action has performed so far, makes sure that human \nhealth and the environment are being adequately protected given the \ncurrent progress, and identifies a few actions for improvement.  A Peri-\nodic Review will happen every five years until the site has reached its \ncleanup goals. \nIn the Periodic Review, Ecology reports that the cleanup is proceeding \nas expected.  However, new information is available about some of the \nchemicals being addressed in the cleanup, and Ecology is asking PSC \nto re-calculate potential soil and groundwater cleanup levels based on \nthe new information, to compare them with the cleanup levels from the \n2010 CAP. \nThe primary chemical that the cleanup has not yet effectively ad-\ndressed is 1,4-dioxane in groundwater.  The CAP originally specified \nthat the affected groundwater should be pumped out from a single \nlocation, treated with an “oxidant” (a chemical that breaks down the \n1,4-dioxane), and discharged to the sewer.  Today, it appears that \nthere are multiple hot spots of contamination, and Ecology believes \nthat a more effective method would be to inject the oxidant directly \ninto the ground in several locations.  A study is also underway to find \nout whether there are bacteria that can help break down even more of \nthe contamination.  Because this plan is different than the plan in the \n2010 CAP, the CAP needs an amendment. \nPublic comment periods will be held for 30 days for each of these doc-\numents, once they are released.\nLocal residents will be notified by a \nmailer. You can learn more about the history of the site and status of \nthe cleanup on these web pages: \nhttps://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/gsp/Sitepage.aspx?csid=2622 \nwww.georgetownneighborhood.com/phillip_services/index.html \n",
