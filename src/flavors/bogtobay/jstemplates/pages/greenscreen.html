    <p>Hello residents of Georgetown and South Park,</p>
    
    <p>Just Health Action (JHA), a non-profit Seattle-based organization
    received a grant from King County Waste Water Treatment Division to build
    an actionable project in the neighborhood to mitigate air pollution.  This
    action-oriented project is called Green Solutions to Air Pollution and will
    leverage the existing resources and work achieved through the Duwamish
    Community Action for Clean Air project coordinated by Duwamish River
    Cleanup Coalition (DRCC). We will be partnering with the DRCC and Urban
    Systems Design’s program “Duwamish Infrastructure Restoration Training”
    (DIRT Corps) to implement the project.
     
<p>After talking to a few residents at community workshops this fall about different types of actionable projects that could reduce air pollution in the neighborhoods, we heard you say that installing a “green screen” was the most exciting option (a detailed description of what a green screen is
below). We now need your feedback about where you would like this green screen to go.  Though we have spoken to some residents already, we want to make sure we hear as many voices as possible before deciding on the final locations (one location per neighborhood). More information about the details of the project are listed below the instructions.</p>
    
    <p><strong>To add your green screen location nomination to the map:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hit the orange button that says 'Add a report to the map'</li>
<li>Move the red pin to mark your exact desired location (by dragging and zooming the map)</li>
<li>Select <em>Green Screen Vote</em> under the dropdown menu where it says 'type of report.'</li>
</ul>

    <a href="#" id="add-place" class="btn btn-block btn-primary btn-large"><span>Add a report to the map!</span></a>

    <p>Feel free to comment on other Green Screen votes that others have chosen
    to help guide the community process. To comment on other nominations just
    click on the pin and a comment window will open to the right.</p>
    
    For those folks not familiar with the project, here is some more
    information.</p>

    <h3>What is a green screen?</h3>
    <p>A green screen is a metal frame structure that will support the growth
    of native and fast growing vines (no invasive species will be used).  In
    two to three years the entire structure will be completely covered by the
    vines, and as the vines grow, so will their ability to absorb air
    pollution.  It will end up looking like a ten-foot tall and twenty to
    thirty foot long wall of green growing things.  An example of a green
    screen on the Goat Hill Parking Garage in Seattle can be found <a href="http://greenscreen.com/docs/Projects%20PDFs/All%20Individual%20Project%20PDFs/Goat%20Hill%20Parking.pdf">here</a>.

    <h3>Why a “green screen”?</h3>
    <p>A green screen is a great tool to help absorb air pollution.  It is a
    version of the green wall or living wall concept that requires very little
    maintenance, so it has the potential to be sustainable for many years to
    come.  The project is something that can be constructed relatively quickly
    on a narrow piece of land that cannot accommodate trees. The green screen
    will look attractive once it’s grown in, as well as reduce noise pollution,
    absorb water, reduce heat, create local jobs, and it is generally good for
    your health. Here is a link to more information about the benefits of
    living walls general:

    <h3>What are we asking you to do?</h3>
    <p>We would like your input on where you think this green screen should be
    placed.  To add your voice, go to HeyDuwamish.org and place a pin on
    the map where you would like the green screen to go (see above for more
    detailed instructions).  You can also add a comment along with your map pin
    on why you picked this spot, and/or comment on other people’s pins. 
     Please comment by the end of December. </p>
     
    <h3>What is the timeline and how will the project get built?</h3>
    <p>Two projects will be built, one in Georgetown, and one in South Park. 
    During the first week of January, we will take all of the pins and
    suggestions into account, and decide on a location for the green screen. 
    We will then negotiate with the landowner or the city as the case may be to
    site the project on their property. We are aiming to begin construction in
    the winter or spring of 2016.  The project will be built by the Duwamish
    Valley Youth Corps, and the Duwamish Infrastructure Restoration Training
    Corps (DIRT Corps)</p>
