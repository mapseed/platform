"The Duwamish River is Seattle's only river, and is one of the most polluted "
"waterways in the US. After 100 years of urban industrialization, it contains "
"more than 40 toxic chemicals above safe limits for humans and the "
"environment, including PCBs, dioxins, carcinogenic PAHs, and arsenic. "
"Studies show that the low income communities living along the river have "
"higher rates of heart disease, asthma, and other illnesses than other "
"Seattle areas. It is also home to salmon, osprey, sea lions, and other "
