<p><em>{{#_}}NYRP Acquired the Bathgate Community Garden in 1999, preserving it as open space in perpetuity. NYRP received funding from Bette Midler to renovate the Bathgate Community Garden, a site that more closely resembles a park in size. Over the next few months, we will work with community members and local stakeholders to design a plan for the space and begin construction soon after.{{/_}}</em></p>
