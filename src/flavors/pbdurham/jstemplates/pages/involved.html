<p><strong>{{#_}}Become a Budget Delegate{{/_}}</strong></p>
<p>{{#_}}Volunteers will be recruited to serve as Budget Delegates. During the Proposal Development phase of the process, these volunteer Budget Delegates will work the community and staff of relevant city of Durham departments to develop ideas into budget proposals. They will receive training and support from Durham PB Implementation Staff to do so.  In addition to supporting the Budget Delegates, Durham PB Implementation staff will also serve to facilitate communication so that projects can be developed in a timely manner.{{/_}}</p>
