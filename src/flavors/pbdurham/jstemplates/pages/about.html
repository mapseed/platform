<p>{{#_}}Durham Participatory Budgeting is a democratic process in which community members from all three City Council wards are directly deciding how to spend $2.4 million ($800,000 per ward).{{/_}}</p>
<p>{{#_}}From November to March 2019, volunteer budget delegates will work to develop these initial ideas into full project proposals. Durham residents will be able to vote in May 2018 to determine the winning projects.{{/_}}</p>
