<small>Rainier Petroleum’s facility in Pier 15 receives and stores shipment of petroleum products. Stomwater discharge in the area was highly polluted. With an industrial stormwater discharge permit, Rainier Petroleum failed to sample the runoff from their site for many years. The facility is now responsible for sampling twice/quarter and updating its stormwater pollution prevention plant to comply with the permit after a lawsuit brought up by the Puget Soundkeeper.                                                                            <br><br>For more information please check out the following articles:
