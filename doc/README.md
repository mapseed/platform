From 0 to Shareabouts in about an hour
======================================

What's here
------------

This package contains the Shareabouts web map application,
which consists of JavaScript, some configuration files that you use to
tailor the app to your needs, and a small glue layer that talks to the
underlying Shareabouts API server. 

The Shareabouts API is *not* part of this package. The easiesy way to get up and running is 
to use the beta hosted API, managed by OpenPlans. 
Go to [api.shareabouts.org](http://api.shareabouts.org) and request access.

Here's a short, optional [primer on the architecture of Shareabouts](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/ARCHITECTURE.md#shareabouts-architecture).

Local Setup
------------

Running a local version of Shareabouts is much easier on a Mac or Linux computer.
If you are using Windows, consider setting up a virtual machine (e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) running a Linux distribution 
([here are some step-by-step instructions for Ubuntu on Windows with VirtualBox](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox#Installing_Virtualbox_in_Windows)).

Shareabouts requires python2.6 or greater.

Install `git`, if not already installed, from [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http;//git-scm.com/downloads).

Install `pip` and `virtualenv`, if not already installed.  These will keep your
python code isolated from the rest of your machine and ensure you have
the correct versions. 

    easy_install pip
    pip install virtualenv

You may need to use `sudo` to install these tools.

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv

Download the code from github:

    git clone https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts.git

Create a new virtual environment inside of the repository folder, and install
the project requirements:

    cd shareabouts
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

NOTE: If you run into trouble with gevent, you can safely comment it out of
the requirements.txt file.  It is not needed for local development.  To comment
it out, just add a hash "#" to the beginning of the line for `gevent`.

NOTE: If you have trouble with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you may need to
install the Python development libraries (for Python.h). The Windows installation has them by default,
but some UNIX-based systems with a pre-installed Python may not. On such systems, you may
need to run `sudo apt-get install python-dev` or download a fresh installer from python.org.

NOTE: Mac OS X users need a command line C/C++ compiler in place for the above steps to work. 
This can be done by downloading Xcode from the App Store and then installing the Command Line Tools
via Xcode's Preferences > Downloads area.

Starting and stopping your server
---------------------------

If you've completed the steps above, you should be ready to run your server. But until [you configure your `local_settings.py`](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/CONFIG.md#step-2-set-up-your-local-settings), you'll see an error. 

To run the development server:

    src/manage.py runserver

The server will, by default, be started at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

To stop the server, press `control-c`.

New to `virtualenv`? If you're returning to work on your map later, be sure to remember
to activate your virtual environment every time you start a new terminal session:

    source env/bin/activate

To close out your virtual environment, run

    deactivate

Running the Shareabouts API Service
------------------------------------

For local development, your best bet is to use OpenPlans' hosted API, data.shareabouts.org. 
[Contact us](http://openplans.org/about/) and request a dataset key. We'll happily provide
hosting to community and non-commercial projects.

Alternatively, install and run the
back-end API service yourself.  To do so, you will want clone the
[Shareabouts API](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts-api).

Configuration
--------------

Next you need to configure the Shareabouts web app.
See [the config docs](CONFIG.md).


Deployment
-------------

See [the deployment docs](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md).


Testing
--------

To run the tests, see [the testing docs](TESTING.md).
